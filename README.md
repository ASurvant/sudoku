# Sudoku Solver
As Ben Laurie famously stated, "Sudoku is a denial of service attack on human intellect."

This is my contribution to freeing up the mental energy of my friends and family. A light-weight sudoku solver built with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript. Use it for free here: http://www.anthonysurvant.com/sudoku

The code uses a recursive loop to test all combinations for any given input. It can be improved upon by generating the HTML grid with a JavaScript loop and making some of the helper code more functional for readability. For now it's fast and it works and we can all go back to making cooler projects!
